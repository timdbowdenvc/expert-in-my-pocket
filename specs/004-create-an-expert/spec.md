## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to provide a URL to an SEO agent, so that I can receive expert recommendations to optimize the page's SEO for a green energy solutions website.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user provides a valid URL for a page on a green energy solutions website, **When** they trigger the SEO analysis, **Then** the agent returns a list of specific, actionable SEO optimisations.
2. **Given** a user provides an invalid URL, **When** they trigger the SEO analysis, **Then** the system returns an error message indicating the URL is not reachable or invalid.

### Edge Cases
- When the URL is for a page not related to green energy, the agent will analyze it and include a warning that the advice may not be optimal.
- If the URL leads to a login page or paywall, the agent will state that it cannot access the content and abort the analysis.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
