# Feature Specification: Schedule MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `006-schedule-mcp-server`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build me an MCP Scheduling server to insert appointments into a google calendar"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: What authentication method should the Schedule MCP Server use to interact with the Google Calendar API? ‚Üí A: OAuth 2.0 (for accessing individual user calendars, requiring user consent).
- Q: How should the target Google Calendar be identified in the incoming appointment request? ‚Üí A: By its unique Calendar ID (e.g., `user@example.com` or a long alphanumeric string).
- Q: How should the system handle conflicting appointments (i.e., new appointment overlaps with an existing one)? ‚Üí A: Create the new appointment regardless of conflicts.
- Q: What are the minimum required fields for an Appointment Request? ‚Üí A: `title`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `calendar_id`.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to schedule appointments in a Google Calendar via an MCP server so that I can manage my calendar events programmatically.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP server receives a valid appointment request, **When** the server processes the request, **Then** a new event is created in the specified Google Calendar.
2. **Given** an event is created, **When** I check my Google Calendar, **Then** the new event is present with the correct details.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Google Calendar API is unavailable?
- What happens if the appointment request data is malformed or incomplete?
- What happens if the specified calendar does not exist or is inaccessible?
- How does the system handle conflicting appointments? The system should create the new appointment regardless of conflicts.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST expose an endpoint to receive appointment requests.
- **FR-002**: System MUST insert appointments into a Google Calendar.
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle authentication with Google Calendar API using OAuth 2.0 for accessing individual user calendars, requiring user consent.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Appointment Request**: Represents the data for a new calendar event with minimum required fields: `title`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `calendar_id`.
- **Google Calendar Event**: The event created in Google Calendar.
