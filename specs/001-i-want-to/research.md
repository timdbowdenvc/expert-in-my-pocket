# Research: Rebranding

## Ambiguity Resolution

*   **Decision**: Code-level identifiers (variables, comments) referencing "T-Levet" or "T-Levet Assistant" will be updated to "Expert In My Pocket".
*   **Rationale**: This ensures long-term maintainability and avoids confusion for future developers. A partial rebrand is a form of technical debt.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Only changing user-visible text. This was rejected because it would lead to an inconsistent and confusing codebase.
