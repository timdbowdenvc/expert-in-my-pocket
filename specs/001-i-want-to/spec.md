**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to rebrand from T-Levet Assistant to Expert In My Pocket. Please make the relevant text and code changes"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to see the application rebranded from "T-Levet Assistant" to "Expert In My Pocket" so that the new branding is consistently applied across the user interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is opened, **When** the main page is displayed, **Then** the title and any prominent text should show "Expert In My Pocket" instead of "T-Levet Assistant".
2. **Given** a user interacts with any part of the application, **When** any text referring to the application's name is shown, **Then** it should be "Expert In My Pocket".

### Edge Cases
- What happens when parts of the application have hardcoded "T-Levet Assistant"?
- How does the system handle code comments or variable names that use the old branding? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should code-level identifiers be changed, or only user-visible text?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace all user-visible instances of "T-Levet Assistant" with "Expert In My Pocket".
- **FR-002**: System MUST update all user-visible instances of "T-Levet" with "Expert In My Pocket".
- **FR-003**: System MUST update any configuration files or metadata that refer to the application name.
- **FR-004**: System MUST update any code comments or internal documentation that refers to the old brand name. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is this in scope?]
