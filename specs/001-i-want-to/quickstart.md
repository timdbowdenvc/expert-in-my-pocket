# Quickstart: Rebranding Verification

1.  **Start the application**: `make dev`
2.  **Open the web UI**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3.  **Verify UI**: Check that all instances of "T-Levet Assistant" have been replaced with "Expert In My Pocket".
4.  **Search the codebase**: Run `grep -r "T-Levet" .` and `grep -r "T-Levet Assistant" .` to ensure no instances remain in the code.
