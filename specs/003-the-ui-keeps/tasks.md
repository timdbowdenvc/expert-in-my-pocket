# Task Breakdown for UI Response Display Debugging with Enhanced Logging

## High-Level Tasks
- Implement a client-side logging utility.
- Integrate logging into prompt submission and response display.
- Configure environment-specific logging (console vs. cloud).
- Implement sensitive data masking/redaction.
- Develop tests for logging functionality.

## Detailed Tasks

### Phase: Core Development - Logging Utility
- [x] **T001**: Create `nextjs/src/lib/utils/logging.ts` utility module.
- [x] **T002**: Implement a `logEvent` function in `nextjs/src/lib/utils/logging.ts` that accepts log level, event type, and data.
- [x] **T003**: Implement environment detection within `nextjs/src/lib/utils/logging.ts` to use `console.log` locally and a cloud logging service (e.g., Google Cloud Logging) for deployed environments.
- [x] **T004**: Implement configurable verbosity levels in `nextjs/src/lib/utils/logging.ts`.
- [x] **T005**: Implement data masking/redaction logic in `nextjs/src/lib/utils/logging.ts` for sensitive fields (e.g., prompt content).

### Phase: Integration - Logging Usage
- [x] **T006**: Integrate `logEvent` into the prompt submission handler in `nextjs/src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx`.
- [x] **T007**: Integrate `logEvent` into the SSE processing logic in `nextjs/src/lib/streaming/stream-processor.ts` to log receipt of events.
- [x] **T008**: Integrate `logEvent` into the response rendering component (e.g., `nextjs/src/components/chat/MessageArea.tsx`) to log display states.

### Phase: Testing - Logging Verification
- [x] **T009 [P]**: Write unit tests for `nextjs/src/lib/utils/logging.ts` utility functions (e.g., redaction, environment detection, verbosity).
- [ ] **T010 [P]**: Write integration tests to verify `console.log` output in local development.
- [ ] **T011 [P]**: Write integration tests to verify logs are sent to a mock cloud logging service in a deployed environment.
