# Feature Specification: UI Response Display Debugging with Enhanced Logging

**Feature Branch**: `003-the-ui-keeps`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the UI keeps not displaying the response from the agent, and requires a refresh and a reselection of the session to get a correct display. I need you to add detailed logging around the user sending a prompt and the prompt being displayed in the in the correct format. The strategy would be to isolate the error to make the system more robust. Include logging that you would find most useful to isolate the error. This only occurs in the Netlify deployed site so may centre around the SSE method of transferring Server Side Events rather than stdiout used locally"

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: What specific logging framework or mechanism should be used in the UI? ‚Üí A: `console.log` for local debugging and integration with a cloud logging service (e.g., Google Cloud Logging) for deployed environments.
- Q: What is the expected volume of log data, and what are the performance implications of this logging? ‚Üí A: Small volume, no significant performance impact in beta.
- Q: Should the logging be configurable (e.g., different verbosity levels for different environments)? ‚Üí A: Yes, allow configuration of verbosity levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error).
- Q: What specific data points should be included in each log entry (e.g., user ID, session ID, message ID, timestamp, event type, payload size)? ‚Üí A: User ID, session ID, message ID, timestamp, event type, payload size, message.
- Q: How should sensitive information (e.g., PII in prompts) be handled in the logs to ensure security and privacy? ‚Üí A: Sensitive information should be masked or redacted in logs.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, when I send a prompt to the agent, I expect the response to be displayed correctly and immediately in the UI without requiring a refresh or reselection of the session. As a developer, I need detailed logging around the prompt submission and response display to diagnose and fix UI display issues, especially in the Netlify deployed environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user sends a prompt, **When** the agent responds, **Then** the UI displays the response correctly without manual intervention.
2. **Given** the application is deployed on Netlify, **When** a user interacts with the agent, **Then** detailed logs are generated covering prompt submission, SSE events, and UI rendering states.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the SSE connection is interrupted?
- What happens if the agent sends an malformed response?
- How does the system handle slow responses from the agent?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI MUST log the state of the prompt submission process, including the prompt content and timestamp.
- **FR-002**: The UI MUST log the receipt and processing of Server-Sent Events (SSE) from the agent, including event types and partial data.
- **FR-003**: The UI MUST log the state of the response rendering process, including when the response starts to display and when it is fully displayed.
- **FR-004**: The logging MUST differentiate between local development (using `console.log`) and Netlify deployed environments (using a cloud logging service like Google Cloud Logging).
- **FR-005**: The logging MUST be detailed enough to isolate issues related to UI display requiring refresh/reselection.
- **FR-006**: The UI logging MUST support configurable verbosity levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error).
- **FR-007**: Sensitive information (e.g., PII in prompts) MUST be masked or redacted in logs.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Log Entry**: A record of an event or state within the UI, containing timestamp, event type, relevant data (user ID, session ID, message ID, payload size, message), and environment context.

## Integration & External Dependencies
- The UI logging will integrate with a cloud logging service (e.g., Google Cloud Logging) for deployed environments.

## Non-Functional Quality Attributes
### Performance
- The logging is expected to generate a small volume of data and have no significant performance impact during the beta phase.

### Security & Privacy
- Sensitive information (e.g., PII in prompts) MUST be masked or redacted in logs.
