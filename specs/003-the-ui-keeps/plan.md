# Implementation Plan: UI Response Display Debugging with Enhanced Logging

**Feature Branch**: `003-the-ui-keeps`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: In Progress
**Input Spec**: /Users/timbo/Dev/expert-in-my-pocket/specs/003-the-ui-keeps/spec.md

---

## ðŸš€ Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Next.js
**Primary Dependencies**: React, TailwindCSS, (potentially a logging library)
**Storage**: N/A (logs sent to console/cloud)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web (Browser), Netlify deployment
**Project Type**: web
**Performance Goals**: Minimal impact on UI responsiveness
**Constraints**: Logging must not expose PII
**Scale/Scope**: Small volume of logs per user interaction

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] Principle I: Modular Architecture - Clear separation of logging concerns.
- [x] Principle II: User-Centric Design - Logging should not degrade user experience.
- [x] Principle III: Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Logging functionality will be tested.
- [x] Principle IV: Cloud-Native Deployment - Integration with cloud logging for Netlify.
- [x] Principle V: Clear and Concise Code - Logging code will be clean and well-documented.
- [x] Principle VI: Agent-Driven Development - This plan follows the agent-driven workflow.
- [x] Principle VII: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Logging configuration will be managed as code.

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION â†’ research task
   - For each dependency â†’ best practices task
   - For each integration â†’ patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** â†’ `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action â†’ endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story â†’ integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh gemini`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract â†’ contract test task [P]
- Each entity â†’ model creation task [P] 
- Each user story â†’ integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
