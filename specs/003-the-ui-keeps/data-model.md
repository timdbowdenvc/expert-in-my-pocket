# Data Model for UI Response Display Debugging with Enhanced Logging

## System Architecture
- The Next.js frontend will be modified to include logging logic.
- Logging will be conditional based on the environment (local vs. Netlify).
- A logging utility module will encapsulate logging functionality.

## Data Model
- The `Log Entry` entity will be implemented as a JavaScript/TypeScript object with fields for user ID, session ID, message ID, timestamp, event type, payload size, and message.

## API Contracts
- No new external API contracts are needed. If integrating with Google Cloud Logging, its existing API will be used.
