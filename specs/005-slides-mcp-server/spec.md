# Feature Specification: Slides MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `005-slides-mcp-server`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want an MCP server that will create a presentation in Google slides when fed with data from the slides agent. The slides can be built from pre-saved styles and layouts and will get persisted somewhere."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Where should the generated Google Slides presentation be persisted? ‚Üí A: In a shared Google Drive folder owned by a service account.
- Q: From where should the MCP server source the pre-saved styles and layouts for new presentations? ‚Üí A: From a dedicated Google Drive folder containing multiple approved layout/style templates.
- Q: What naming convention should be used for the generated presentation files? ‚Üí A: Supplied title suffixed with date.
- Q: How should the specific template and layout be identified in the incoming Presentation Request data from the slides agent? ‚Üí A: By a human-readable name (e.g., "Company Standard Template") for the template presentation.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the slides agent, I want to generate a Google Slides presentation from data so that I can have a structured document created automatically.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the slides agent has structured data for a presentation, **When** it sends this data to the Slides MCP Server, **Then** a new presentation is created in Google Slides.
2. **Given** a presentation has been successfully created, **When** I check the designated persistence location, **Then** I can access the newly created Google Slides presentation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the data from the slides agent is malformed or incomplete?
- How does the system handle authentication errors with the Google Slides API?
- What is the expected behavior if a specified pre-saved layout does not exist?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST expose an endpoint to receive presentation data from the slides agent.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use the received data to create a new presentation in Google Slides.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST support creating slides based on pre-saved styles and layouts sourced from a dedicated Google Drive folder containing multiple approved layout/style templates, identified by a human-readable name in the incoming data.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST persist the created presentation in a shared Google Drive folder owned by a service account, using the supplied title suffixed with the date as the file name.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the calling agent (e.g., API errors, data validation failures).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Presentation Request**: Represents the data sent from the slides agent. It should contain all necessary information for creating the presentation, such as slide content, desired layouts, and presentation title.
- **Google Slides Presentation**: The final output document created in the user's or a service account's Google Slides.
