## üöÄ Technical Context
*(No specific user-provided details for this phase)*

## üí° Research & Exploration (Phase 0)
*(Generate `research.md` in this phase)*

### Key Questions
- How to create a service account using `gcloud` commands or Python client libraries?
- How to grant roles to a service account using `gcloud` commands or Python client libraries?
- How to specify a service account for a deployed Vertex AI Agent Engine agent?
- How to log the service account used by the deployed agent?

### Research Tasks
- Investigate `gcloud iam service-accounts create` command.
- Investigate `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` command.
- Review Vertex AI Agent Engine deployment documentation for service account configuration.
- Explore logging mechanisms in Python for agent deployment.

### Expected Outcome
- Clear understanding of `gcloud` commands/Python APIs for service account management.
- Identified method for configuring service account during agent deployment.
- Strategy for logging service account usage.

## üèóÔ∏è Design & Data Modeling (Phase 1)
*(Generate `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md` in this phase)*

### System Architecture
- The existing deployment script (`app/agent_engine_app.py`) will be modified.
- A new function or modification to `deploy_agent` will handle service account creation/specification.
- Google Cloud IAM API will be used for service account management.

### Data Model
- No new complex data models are required. The existing `DeploymentConfig` will be extended to include service account information.

### API Contracts
- No new external API contracts are needed. The existing Google Cloud IAM API will be used.

### Quickstart Guide
- Update the deployment instructions to include steps for service account creation/specification.

## üìã Task Breakdown (Phase 2)
*(Generate `tasks.md` in this phase)*

### High-Level Tasks
- [Break down the implementation into major, independent tasks]

### Detailed Tasks
- [Further decompose high-level tasks into actionable, smaller units]

---

## ‚úÖ Verification & Testing
*(Integrate with existing test strategy)*

### Unit Tests
- Outline critical components requiring unit tests
    - Test service account creation logic.
    - Test role granting logic.
    - Test service account specification in deployment.

### Integration Tests
- Describe scenarios for integration testing
    - Deploy an agent with a specified service account and verify it runs with that identity.
    - Deploy an agent without a specified service account and verify a new one is created and used.

### End-to-End Tests
- Define user-facing test cases
    - Deploy an agent with a service account, grant it a specific role (e.g., Storage Object Viewer), and verify the agent can access a GCS bucket.
