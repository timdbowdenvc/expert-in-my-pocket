# Feature Specification: Agent Deployment with Service Account

**Feature Branch**: `002-to-use-agents`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "to use agents to execute different tools I need the agent to run under the context of a service account that I can add roles to. You need to create the service account and update the deploy to be under the service account. The service account initially needs to be a vertex AI user."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: What should happen if a service account is specified during deployment, but it does not exist? ‚Üí A: A new service account should be created with the specified name.
- Q: How should the service account for the agent be named? ‚Üí A: <<project-id>>-ai-agent-account
- Q: What should happen to the service account when the agent is deleted? ‚Üí A: The service account should be left as is, requiring manual cleanup.
- Q: Besides "Vertex AI User", should the service account have any other roles by default to follow the principle of least privilege? ‚Üí A: Yes, add the "Logs Writer" and "Storage Object Viewer" roles.
- Q: How can we verify which service account a deployed agent is running as? ‚Üí A: The deployment logs should include the service account being used.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to deploy an agent that runs with the identity of a service account, so that I can grant it specific permissions to access Google Cloud resources.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a service account with the "Vertex AI User" role exists, **When** the agent is deployed, **Then** the deployed agent should execute as that service account.
2. **Given** the agent is deployed with a service account, **When** the agent tries to access a Google Cloud resource, **Then** the access should be governed by the roles granted to the service account.

### Edge Cases
- If a service account name is provided during deployment but the service account does not exist, the system will create a new service account with that name.
- What happens when the service account does not have the necessary permissions for deployment?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The deployment process MUST support specifying a service account for the deployed agent.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST create a new service account if one is not provided, named according to the convention: <<project-id>>-ai-agent-account.
- **FR-003**: The created service account MUST be granted the "Vertex AI User", "Logs Writer", and "Storage Object Viewer" roles by default.
- **FR-004**: The deployed agent MUST run under the context of the specified or created service account.
- **FR-005**: The deployment script MUST be updated to handle the service account configuration.
- **FR-006**: If a service account name is provided but the service account does not exist, the system MUST create a new service account with the provided name.
- **FR-007**: When an agent is deleted, the associated service account MUST NOT be deleted or disabled automatically and will require manual cleanup.
- **FR-008**: The deployment process MUST log the email address of the service account being used for the agent deployment.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Observability
- The service account used by a deployed agent MUST be verifiable by inspecting the deployment logs.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Service Account**: Represents the identity of the deployed agent. It has roles and permissions that determine what Google Cloud resources the agent can access. The service account should be named following the convention: <<project-id>>-ai-agent-account. The lifecycle of the service account is not tied to the agent; it will not be deleted when the agent is deleted.
